Solved by luck.  I just happened to hit up on my keyboard by habbit and it caused a seg fault.

The segfault prints the flag:

void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
    printf("\n%s\n", flag);
    fflush(stdout);
    exit(1);
}

Which is set in main:

signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler);


The segfault happens because:

#define BUFSIZE 32

char choice1[BUFSIZE];
scanf("%s", choice1);
