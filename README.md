# picoCTF 2024 #

This was a private repo for the [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) 2024 for the team [YegSec](https://www.yegsec.ca/) [Sneakers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_XRqJV2zdk) but now that the compition is over I'm making the repo public so others can use it to learn.  The layout of the repo is a folder for each problem where the name of the folder is the name of the problem.  The `README.md` file will either contain the solution, if I have solved the problem, or just my ideas, theories, etc, if I haven't solved the problem yet.

Feel free to open a [issue](https://github.com/mrbiggred/picoCTF2024/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/mrbiggred/picoCTF2024/pulls) to update any errors you find.  I'm not sure if I will take PRs for solutions I haven't solved yet but that could change.
